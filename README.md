optiTeam
============

**optiTeam** implements a small tool to obtain the optimal team at hockeymanager (HM), a swiss hockey fantasy league game. You can find the game here: http://hockeymanager.ch/.

The constraints of the optimization problem are as follows: given the imputed budget, the optimal team 
maximizes the sum of the points of 2 goalies, 8 defensemen, and 12 forwards, with a maximum of 4 
foreign players.
                
Be aware that this tool does not take into account the lines composition, the injuries, or the constancy of 
the players. To maximize the points obtained in the game, it is sometimes better to take more constant players in order to 
get line bonuses instead of players that perform very well only from time to time.
                
Also, it only shows the team that would have gotten the maximum points until now. Use it as a predictive tool 
of the players' performance with caution.
